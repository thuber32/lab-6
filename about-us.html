          </header>
          <p>Pete is an avid fisherman and in 2005, he took a trip with his father to the boundry waters. During this
            trip, Pete caught
            so many fish and was so proud. However, when he brought all of that salmon home, the rest of the family was
            less than pleased.
            Later a friend was talking about the desire to have healthy protein packed baked goods and the idea hit
            Pete, why not try
            to meet the needs of his friend and the plethra of salmon with his favorite dessert, cookies. The idea was
            born.
