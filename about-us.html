            </header>
            <p>Pete is an avid fisherman and in 2005, he took a trip with his father to the boundry waters.  During this trip, Pete caught 
          so many fish and was so proud.  However, when he brought all of that salmon home, the rest of the family was less than pleased.
          Later a friend was talking about the desire to have healthy protein packed baked goods and the idea hit Pete, why not try 
          to meet the needs of his friend and the plethra of salmon with his favorite dessert, cookies.  The idea was born.
